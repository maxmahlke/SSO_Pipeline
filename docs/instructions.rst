How To
######

Input Files
===========

Input files are the survey images, passed to the pipeline in one directory:

.. code-block :: bash

    $ ssos path/to/images

The images **must** have a ``.fits`` file ending to be recognized by the script.

If weight images shall be passed to the SExtractor runs, specify the directory containing the weight images using the `WEIGHT_IMAGES` parameter in the ``default.ssos``. The weight images need to have the same filename as the exposures they shall be applied on, but with a ``_SCI_EXTENSION.weight`` file extension replacing the ``.fits``, where `SCI_EXTENSION` has to be replaced by the appropriate extension integer. If no science extension is specified (equivalent to setting `SCI_EXTENSION` to ``all``), simply replace the ``.fits`` extension with ``.weight``.

Output Files
============

The script creates several directories in the target directory (current working directory unless specified with the ``-t`` option). The cats directory contains the SExtractor and SCAMP catalogues and the final output `ssos_$CURRENTDATETIME.csv`. For every SExtractor catalogue, there is also one .ahead file with the same filename. This file contains the observation date as MJD-OBS keyword, which is required for the subsequent run of SCAMP. SCAMP looks for extensions of catalogue headers in .ahead files.

The cutouts directory contains the cutouts made by SWarp of the SSO detections. In the logs directory, you can find the log file of the pipeline, following the naming scheme `ssos_$CURRENTDATETIME.log`, carrying the same DATETIME appendix as the output `csv` file. The skybot directory stores the SkyBoT query results.

To judge the results of the pipeline, first go into the logfile. It looks like this:

.. code-block :: bash

    $ cat /tmp/logs/sso_20180906142433.log

In case an SSO was detected, you should look at the ``cats/ssos.csv`` file and the cutouts to verify the detection. In ``cats/ssos.csv``, you can also find basic SkyBoT parameters, if the object was successfully matched. For more detailed information on the possible match, look into the SkyBoT queries in ``skybot/``.

Command-Line API
================

Again, the command-line API is heavily inspired by the SExtractor and SCAMP softwares. The following help is printed when the pipeline is called without arguments or with the ``-h`` or ``--help`` flag set:
